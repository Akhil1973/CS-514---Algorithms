1. Given an RNA sequence, such as ACAGU, we can predict its secondary structure 
   by tagging each nucleotide as (, ., or ). Each matching pair of () must be 
   AU, GC, or GU (or their mirror symmetries: UA, CG, UG). 
   We also assume pairs can _not_ cross each other. 
   The following are valid structures for ACAGU:
A.  
    time complexity O(n^3)
    space complexity O(n^2)

2.Total number of all possible structures
A.
    time complexity O(n^3)
    space complexity O(n^2)

k-best structures: output the 1-best, 2nd-best, ... kth-best structures.
A.
    time complexity O(n^3 +nklogk)
    space complexity O(n^3)
